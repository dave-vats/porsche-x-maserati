# AERYTH — Porsche × Maserati Concept Website (3D)

**Porsche x Maserati — just a simple idea I had one day:**  
I wondered what it would be like if these two iconic competitors collaborated. How would their website look?

At the same time, my tuition where I was learning,, was hosting a project fair. I decided to take this concept and build a 3D website that represents my creativity, technical ability, and design sense — something unique and original that does not exist anywhere else.
